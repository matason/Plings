Plings

Determine the best way to update users Plings
---------------------------------------------
Take into consideration a large {users} table.

Currently updating when a user logs in and on cron (current hook_cron() code is
not suitable).

Perhaps before making a call to the Plings API it would be good to check
whether {plings} contains rows with filter_type and filter_value that match for
the user and duplicate those rows with the user ID.



Venues and Providers
--------------------
Establish whether venues and providers are unique to activities or whether the
info for a venue and/or provider may vary per activity.

A flaw at the moment is that venue and provider data will never be updated.

Work out a strategy for venue and provider data, do we simply let it mount up?



Users ability to select how 'their' Plings are filtered
-------------------------------------------------------
Currently this is set by the administrator and is limited to town or postcode.



Add support for more user location detection methods
----------------------------------------------------
Currently on location_user module is supported.



Review Views integration
------------------------
Is there more that could be done here?



Configuration
-------------
Currently have to save configuration twice, add jQuery to pull in the Filter
value options when the User location detection method is selected/changed.
